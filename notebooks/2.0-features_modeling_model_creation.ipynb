    "O modelo desenvolvido generalizou bem, assumindo uma taxa maior de falso negativos como discutido anteriormente, além da otimização de parâmetros nos dar uma visão maior entre o sacrifício que ocorre no balanço das predições referente ao que for mais benéfico para o negócio. Por exemplo, sacrificamos um pouco a precisão em detrimento do recall, o que na otimização levou a um aumento significativo dos falsos positivos, mas pode ser um pouco além da conta porque estamos tentando previnir e não jogar todos para uma classe só.\n",
